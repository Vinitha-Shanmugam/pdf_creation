the World Wide Web and do the indexing to each each website so that l ater we can use as a 
source of reference without having to browse through the website again. At the end of the task 
this time around there are the major functions that will be developed, namely the merger of the 
OLX.co.id website, Berniaga.com, and bukalap ak.com. In this application there are features that 
can be used that is looking for a third of the website data, can sort data starts from the latest ad 
is the cheapest and most expensive, can display data hot items website. The application was 
created by using an android -based platform.  
 This application displays the results in the mobile application. The results that emerged 
as the result of the search data from all three of the website.  The system takes data from the main 
website i.e. OLX.co.id, Berniaga.com, and bukalapak.com and display its data into the interface 
of mobile applications in accordance with the input data of the keyword ads that are desired by 
the user application.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement Solves Child Abduction 
Case with LexisNexis¬Æ Advanced Investigative Solution
Overview
The mission of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) is to 
promote public safety and strengthen domestic security. Headquartered in Tallahassee, FDLE conducts independent investigations and coordinates multi-jurisdictional and special criminal investigations with local, state and federal authorities in four key investigative focus areas: major drugs, violent crime, public integrity and fraud/economic crime.
The Challenge
Special Agent Chris Woehr is assigned to the economic crimes squad. When calling a former colleague to check on the status of a case, the colleague mentioned that a baby was just abducted from the maternity ward of a local hospital.
Police responded immediately, locking down the hospital and establishing 
a perimeter; however, they believed the suspect had already exited the hospital. The police had a description of the car, including the age, make and model and a partial license plate number. The Sanford Police Dept. issued a ‚ÄúBOLO‚Äù (Be On the Look Out) alert for the vehicle based on this information. Upon hearing the news, Agent Woehr approached Robin Sparkman, an analyst at FDLE, with the vehicle information. She entered the information into the dFACTS system (FDLE‚Äôs name for their investigative solution developed with the LexisNexis
¬Æ Advanced Investigative Solution 
platform). Ms. Sparkman used the three known license plate characters to run a Wild Card search‚Äîa powerful feature which produces license plate and vehicle matches based on incomplete information. She received a list of five vehicles, four of which were in central Florida. One vehicle was registered to a female in the city where the abduction took place.
FDLE utilized an additional source to get a description of the woman and 
was able to match the description with the suspect in less than 10 minutes. Ms. Sparkman and Special Agent Woehr relayed the information back to the investigators, who were able to match the driver‚Äôs license photo of the suspect with surveillance camera footage from the hospital. Police had been on the lookout for the vehicle and a unit in the neighboring city of Lake Mary responded that it had spotted the car and was conducting a traffic stop. At this time, the unit was advised of the identification and match, and the police found the infant boy unharmed in the suspect‚Äôs car.
Risk Solutions
GovernmentThe entire incident transpired in about one hour and  
15 minutes‚Äîfrom  
the time the police were called to the hospital until the  
time they recovered the infant.
The Solution
The LexisNexis Advanced Investigative Solution is a web-based tool that 
integrates public records and law enforcement data sets to help instantly uncover leads that would normally take days or weeks to track down manually. The solution can assist in locating people, detecting fraud, uncovering assets and discovering connections between associates. As a result, the system helps shorten investigation time, free up valuable staff, minimize costs associated with lengthy investigations and, in some cases, save lives.
The Results
Using the Advanced Investigative Solution, FDLE information analysts obtained a list of five vehicle matches within minutes, enabling them to further narrow down the initial matches based on vehicle description and to solve the crime quickly. The entire incident transpired in about one hour and 15 minutes‚Äîfrom the time the police were called to the hospital until the time they recovered the infant.
